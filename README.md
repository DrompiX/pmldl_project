To reproduce an experiment results just run all cells in the corresponding notebook:

 - NCF.ipynb contains training and testing code for Neural Collaborative Filtering model
 - DLMF.ipynb - for Deep Learning based Matrix Factorization 
 - SVD_KNN_experiments.ipynb - for SVD and KNN
 - RBM.ipynb - for Restricted Boltzman Machine
 
 
 Games_datamining.ipynb and data_preprocessing.ipynb contain code used for datasets collection.
